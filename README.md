### Evaluation Criteria:

* For the local storage, you should use Realm or CoreData
* Keep code as clean as possible
* Your code should be easy to maintain
* Do not try to build a fancy UI, your implementation details are more important
* Consistency on code convention and indentation
* Library usage (No more and less than required)
