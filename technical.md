## What is it? 🙋🏻

It's a Todo application with offline suppoert by the use of Core Data which has been developed as a code challenge. It's written purely in Swift without using 3rd party frameworks.


## What do you want to show by this project❓

How DO I **respect** the topics below while developing a software:

* Reusability of the code 🔁
* Clean Code Principles 🧼
* SOLID Principles 🥰
* Design Patterns 🖌
* Loose coupling 🙇🏻‍♂️
* Abstraction ☁️
* Modularity 🧱
* Testability 🧪
* and Clean Architecture for sure! 😁

## Architecture (heart of the app❤️)
#### MVVM-C + Services

## Why?
**MVVM?**
MVC architecture in iOS translated to Massive View Controller. Because soon or late your code base converts to a spagethi code-base easily. So, I used this architecture to make a passive ViewController by outsourcing business logic to ModelView layer.
**Coordinator Design Patter?**
It makes the app coordination super simple. Plus, it brings loosly coupling betweein ViewControllers. Thus, we'll have a more testable code base.
**Services?**
**Models?**
**CoreData testability?**
