* You can build the user interface with XIBs || Storyboards || Code
* For the local storage, you should use Realm or CoreData

### Evaluation Criteria:

* For the local storage, you should use Realm or CoreData
* Keep code as clean as possible
* Your code should be easy to maintain
* Do not try to build a fancy UI, your implementation details are more important
* Consistency on code convention and indentation
* Library usage (No more and less than required)
* Git usage
* A README.md which describes technical details/decisions
* Unit Tests or UI Tests are bonus
